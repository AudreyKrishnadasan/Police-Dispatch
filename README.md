# Police-Dispatch
Police Dispatch Simulation:

This project simulates a 911 call triage. I use a Minheap to organize and create a simulation to deal with all of the incoming 911 "calls" (events). This project deepened my understanding of queue's and how to work with the specific data structure. We did this project in my data structures class - I had a lot of fun working through my bugs and minimizg my time and memory complexity.
